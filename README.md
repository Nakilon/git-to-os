After pushing to the master branch of the repository that uses this Github Action contents of its directories will be syncronized with corresponding Object Storage (such as Yandex Object Storage or Google Cloud Storage) buckets.

For example I am now updating my home page using it. If you want to do the same follow the steps described in each corresponding README.

Google is not included in this repo yet. Use the legacy [Git-to-GCS Github Action](https://github.com/Nakilon/git-to-gcs) instead).
